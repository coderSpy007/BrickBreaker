## Brick Breaker Game
This game is the final project for the Mobile Application Development course, developed with a team of four members. 
The source code has been updated by me to include various levels of difficulty, different ball types, and scenes with distinct features. 
The criteria for receiving awards in each level, as well as the recording and reset of gameplay statistics, have also been incorporated.


Create with Java at Android Studio.
